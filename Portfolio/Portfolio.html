            <h3>Truth Or Dare Game</h3>
            <p>Truth or Dare is a fun party game where 
                players take turns choosing between answering 
                a personal question truthfully or completing a 
                daring challenge. Itâ€™s a great way to break the 
                ice and add excitement to any gathering!</p>

            <h3>IoT Plant based monitoring system</h3>
            <p>An IoT-based Plant Monitoring System is a technological 
                solution designed to automate and optimize the care of 
                plants by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) devices 
                and sensors. This system is ideal for home gardeners, 
                agricultural professionals, or anyone looking to enhance 
                their plant care through technology.</p>

            <h3>Expression_tracker_during gameplay</h3>
            <p>This project is a MERN stack-based project 
                designed to evaluate the effectiveness of 
                educational games for dyslexic children. 
                By tracking facial expressions during gameplay, 
                the system helps developers, therapists, and educators 
                gain insights into how children interact with games, 
                identifying challenges and refining educational tools.</p>
